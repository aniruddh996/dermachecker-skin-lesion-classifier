# dermachecker-skin-lesion-classifier
Melanoma classification using CNN (transfer learning)

## Overview

Dermachecker is a deep-learning-powered image classification app built to classify skin lesion images into one of seven categories.
The model is based on DenseNet121 and fine-tuned on a dermoscopic skin image dataset.

This was a personal project I worked on a few years ago to explore AI in healthcare and medical image classification. Recently, I refreshed the repository and added an interactive inference app built using Streamlit.

## Features
ðŸ§  Deep Learning Model â€” DenseNet121 fine-tuned for multiclass classification
